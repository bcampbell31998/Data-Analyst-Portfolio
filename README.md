Hello, I am Brandon! I am a data-driven professional with a robust background in data analysis and full stack engineering. Over the past three years, I have graduated with my MS. in Data Science, and I’ve developed expertise in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, which has consistently driven operational efficiency and business growth. My experience spans industries, including sports analytics and quality assurance, where I have successfully improved data accuracy, integrity, and decision-making processes.
